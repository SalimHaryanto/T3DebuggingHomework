# T3 Debugging Homework
This project contains some homework that trainers are expected to complete for certification as trainers in App Development with Swift.

Open up the project in Xcode and go to the Main.storyboard. There are instructions and a series of tasks you're expected to complete, and some bugs to work around (or resolve).

The final homework should be submitted by the end of the ACT Certification week to your Apple Mentor trainer.
